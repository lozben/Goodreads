# Goodreads
For this project, my objective is to analyze a substantial dataset of book reviews from Goodreads. The ultimate goal is to train a model that can accurately predict a book's rating based on various data points, including reviews.

The first part of my project will focus on exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature generation, and text processing. I'll be analyzing the dataset to identify key features that may impact a book's rating and using natural language processing techniques to extract insights from the reviews.

In the second part, I will explain my motivation for selecting a particular model and describe the process of training the chosen model to generate out-of-fold predictions.

In the final part of the project, I will use boosting techniques to further enhance the accuracy of my predictions. This will involve iteratively training and combining multiple models to improve the overall performance of my predictive model.
